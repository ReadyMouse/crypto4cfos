## Exercise Set 1: Blockchain Fundamentals

### Exercise 1.1: Understanding Blockchain Structure

**Objective**: Visualize and understand the basic structure of a blockchain.

**Instructions**: 
1. Create a simple blockchain diagram with 5 blocks
2. Each block should contain:
   - Block number
   - Timestamp
   - Transaction data (3-4 sample transactions)
   - Previous block hash
   - Current block hash

**Sample Data**:
```
Block 1: Genesis Block
- Timestamp: 2024-01-01 00:00:00
- Transactions: 
  * Alice sends 100 BTC to Bob
  * Charlie sends 50 BTC to David
- Previous Hash: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
- Current Hash: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t1u2v3w4x5y6z

Block 2:
- Timestamp: 2024-01-01 00:10:00
- Transactions:
  * Bob sends 25 BTC to Eve
  * David sends 30 BTC to Frank
- Previous Hash: 1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p7q8r9s0t1u2v3w4x5y6z
- Current Hash: [Calculate based on Block 2 data + Previous Hash]
```

**Questions for Reflection**:
1. What happens if someone tries to change a transaction in Block 1?

| Proof of Authority | | | | |

**Scenario Analysis**:

**Task**: Recommend the best consensus mechanism and justify your choice.

### Exercise 1.3: Cryptographic Hash Functions

**Objective**: Understand how cryptographic hashing works in blockchain.

**Instructions**:

2. Hash the following strings and observe the results:
   - "Hello World"
   - "Hello World" (note the space)
   - "hello world"
   - "Hello World!"

**Questions**:
1. What do you notice about the hash outputs?
2. How does this property help with blockchain security?
3. What would happen if you changed just one character in a block?
