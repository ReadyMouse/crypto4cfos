## Introduction

While Module 1 introduced you to the basics of crypto, Module 2 dives deep into the foundational technology that makes it all possible: blockchain. Understanding blockchain technology is essential because it's not just the foundation of cryptocurrency—it's rapidly becoming a transformative force across multiple industries, from finance and supply chain management to healthcare and government services.

## What is Blockchain?

At its most fundamental level, a blockchain is an immutable database, a ledger that can't be changed or altered. This is exactly what we want when it comes to money, a records system that no one can tamper with, go back and change a transaction, or arbitrarily add zeros to an account balance. The term "blockchain" comes from its structure: data is stored in blocks, and these blocks are linked together in a chain using cryptographic techniques.

Think of a blockchain as a digital ledger that's maintained by thousands of computers simultaneously, each holding an identical copy. When a new transaction occurs, it's broadcast to the entire network. The network then works together to verify the transaction and add it to a new block. Once a block is full of transactions, it's cryptographically linked to the previous block, creating an unbreakable chain that goes back to the very first block—the genesis block.

What makes blockchain revolutionary is its combination of three key properties:
1. Decentralization
1. Transparency
1. Immutability

Unlike traditional databases that are controlled by a single entity, blockchains are distributed across a network of computers, with no single point of control. Every transaction is visible to everyone on the network, creating unprecedented transparency. And once data is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. It becomes permanent and immutable.

## How Blockchain Works

To understand how blockchain works, let's walk through the process of a typical transaction. Imagine Alice wants to send 1 Bitcoin to Jared. Here's what happens:

First, Alice creates a transaction using her digital wallet. This transaction includes Jared's public address (like an email address), the amount she wants to send, and a digital signature that proves she owns the Bitcoin she's trying to spend. The digital signature is created using Alice's private key—a secret number that only she knows.

[!Note] Just like an email address is public, so are wallet addresses. It's only anonoymous so long as the link between real human and address is private. Hence its often refered to as pseudoanonimity.  

Once Alice submits the transaction, it's broadcast to the entire Bitcoin network. Thousands of computers around the world receive this transaction and begin the verification process. They check several things: Does Alice actually own the Bitcoin she's trying to spend? Has she already spent this Bitcoin elsewhere? Is the transaction properly formatted?

If the transaction passes all these checks, it gets added to a pool of pending transactions waiting to be included in the next block. This is where mining comes in—a process we'll explore in detail later. For now, suffice it to say that miners compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle, and the winner gets to create the next block of transactions.

When a miner successfully creates a new block, it includes Alice's transaction along with many others. The block is then cryptographically linked to the previous block in the chain, and the entire network updates their copies of the blockchain to include this new block. At this point, Alice's transaction is confirmed and becomes part of the permanent record.

The beauty of this system is that it eliminates the need for trust in a central authority. Instead of relying on a bank to verify and record the transaction, the entire network works together to ensure accuracy and security. This distributed approach makes the system incredibly robust as there's no single point of failure, and no single entity can control or manipulate the network.

## Mining and Consensus Mechanisms

Mining is one of the most misunderstood aspects of blockchain technology, but it's absolutely crucial to how many blockchains operate. At its core, mining is the process by which new transactions are verified and added to the blockchain. But it's also the mechanism that creates new cryptocurrency and secures the network against attacks.

Let's break down how mining works in the Bitcoin network. Every 10 minutes or so, a new block of transactions needs to be added to the blockchain. To determine who gets to create this block, the network uses a consensus mechanism called Proof of Work. Here's how it works:

The network creates a mathematical puzzle that's extremely difficult to solve but easy to verify. This puzzle involves finding a number (called a nonce) that, when combined with the block's data and run through a cryptographic hash function, produces a result that meets certain criteria. The criteria are designed to make the puzzle so difficult that it takes significant computational power to solve.

Miners around the world compete to solve this puzzle first. They run their computers at full capacity, trying different nonces until one of them finds the solution. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to create the new block, add it to the blockchain, and receive a reward in the form of !! newly created Bitcoin !! plus any transaction fees.

This system serves several important purposes. First, it creates new Bitcoin in a controlled, predictable way. Second, it secures the network by making it extremely expensive to attack. To successfully attack the Bitcoin network, an attacker would need to control more than 50% of the total mining power. This feat that would require billions of dollars worth of specialized hardware.

!! But wait: Aren't they just mining new Bitcoin every 10 minutes? That sounds like a serious hyperinflation risk! Yes and no. Each transaction also adds a gas fee, a processing fee, if you will. This is paid by the sender in the transaction and the gas fee is literally burned, destroyed, exists no more. The gas fee destruction mitigates the hyperinflation risk, but the potential for some inflation does exist.

However, Proof of Work has significant drawbacks, particularly its environmental impact. The computational power required for mining consumes enormous amounts of electricity, leading to concerns about sustainability. This has led to the development of alternative consensus mechanisms.

Proof of Stake is one such alternative that's gaining popularity. Instead of using computational power to secure the network, Proof of Stake uses economic incentives. Validators (the equivalent of miners) must "stake" a certain amount of cryptocurrency as collateral. If they behave honestly, they earn rewards. If they try to attack the network, they lose their stake.

Other consensus mechanisms include Delegated Proof of Stake, where token holders vote for validators, and Proof of Authority, where trusted entities are given the right to create blocks. Each mechanism has its own trade-offs in terms of security, decentralization, and efficiency.

## Public vs Private Blockchains

Not all blockchains are created equal, and understanding the differences between public and private blockchains is crucial. The choice between public and private blockchains can have significant implications for business applications, regulatory compliance, and security.

### Public Blockchains

Public blockchains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are open to anyone. Anyone can download the software, join the network, and participate in the consensus process. These networks are truly decentralized, with no single entity in control. They offer maximum transparency and censorship resistance, but they also have limitations in terms of scalability and privacy.

Bitcoin operates on an **open ledger** where every transaction is visible to everyone. Think of it like a public checkbook where anyone can see all the deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. This transparency provides several benefits: it prevents fraud, enables audit trails, and ensures no one can create money out of thin air. However, it also means that transaction patterns, wallet balances, and spending habits are visible to anyone who cares to look.

Some cryptocurrencies like Zcash operate on **opaque ledgers** where transaction details are encrypted and hidden from public view. Think of it like a private checkbook where only the account holders know the details of their transactions. The network still validates that transactions are legitimate (no double-spending, sufficient funds, etc.), but the actual amounts, sender, and receiver remain confidential. This provides the privacy benefits of physical cash while maintaining the security and global accessibility of digital transactions.

### Private Blockchains

Private blockchains, on the other hand, are controlled by a single organization or consortium. Access is restricted to authorized participants, and the consensus process is typically much simpler and faster. Private blockchains can offer better performance and privacy, but they sacrifice some of the decentralization and transparency that make public blockchains revolutionary.

### Choosing the Right Approach

The choice between public vs private; open vs opaque ledgers often comes down to the specific use case:

- **Open ledgers** like Bitcoin are ideal for applications requiring transparency and auditability, such as public registries or systems where trust is built through visibility.

- **Opaque ledgers** like Zcash are better suited for applications requiring privacy, such as personal transactions, business dealings, or situations where financial privacy is a priority.

## Smart Contracts

A smart contract is essentially a computer program that automatically executes when certain conditions are met. Unlike traditional contracts that rely on legal enforcement, smart contracts are enforced by code.

Let's look at a simple example. Imagine a traditional escrow service where a buyer and seller use a third party to hold funds until the transaction is completed. With a smart contract, this entire process can be automated. The buyer sends cryptocurrency to a smart contract address. The seller ships the product. When the buyer confirms receipt, the smart contract automatically releases the funds to the seller. If there's a dispute, the smart contract can hold the funds until the dispute is resolved.

The implications of smart contracts are enormous. They can automate complex financial transactions, reduce the need for intermediaries, and create new types of financial instruments. For example, smart contracts can be used to create automated insurance policies that pay out immediately when certain conditions are met, or to create complex derivative instruments that automatically settle based on market conditions.

However, smart contracts also present new challenges. They're only as good as the code they're written in, and bugs in smart contract code can lead to significant financial losses. The infamous [DAO hack in 2016](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/09/coindesk-turns-10-how-the-dao-hack-changed-ethereum-and-crypto), where attackers exploited a bug in a smart contract to steal millions of dollars worth of Ethereum, is a cautionary tale about the importance of proper smart contract development and auditing.

## Blockchain Security

Blockchain security is often touted as one of the technology's greatest strengths, but it's important to understand both the security benefits and the potential vulnerabilities. The security of blockchain comes from several key factors: cryptography, decentralization, and consensus mechanisms.

Cryptography is the foundation of blockchain security. Every transaction is secured using advanced cryptographic techniques that make it virtually impossible to forge or alter. Digital signatures ensure that only the rightful owner can spend cryptocurrency, while hash functions create the unbreakable links between blocks.

Decentralization provides security through redundancy. Instead of having a single point of failure, blockchain networks are distributed across thousands of computers. Even if some nodes are compromised or go offline, the network continues to operate. This makes blockchain networks extremely resistant to attacks and censorship.

Consensus mechanisms provide security by making attacks economically unfeasible. In Proof of Work systems, attacking the network requires controlling more than 50% of the mining power, which would cost billions of dollars. In Proof of Stake systems, attacking the network would require staking enormous amounts of cryptocurrency, which would be lost if the attack is detected.

However, blockchain security is not perfect, and there are several potential vulnerabilities that should be aware of. The most significant is the 51% attack, where a single entity gains control of more than half of the network's mining power or stake. While extremely expensive and difficult to execute, such attacks are theoretically possible, especially in newer blockchains with less total miners.

Another vulnerability is the human factor. While the blockchain itself may be secure, the systems that interact with it, like exchanges, wallets, and smart contracts, can have security flaws. The majority of cryptocurrency thefts occur not through attacks on the blockchain itself, but through attacks on these peripheral systems. 

[!Note] Attacks on gold in secure bank vaults are rare, attacks on the gold in transit are much more common. Crypto is the same. Where the blockchain is strong, the wallet may be weak.

## Apps, Wallets, and Addresses

Let's talk about how users actually can interact with blockchain technology. The interface between humans and blockchain networks comes through applications, wallets, and addresses, each serving distinct but interconnected purposes.

### Apps

**Cryptocurrency applications** (often called "dApps" or decentralized applications) are software programs that interact with blockchain networks. These applications provide user-friendly interfaces for complex blockchain operations, making cryptocurrency accessible to non-technical users.

1. **MetaMask** is perhaps the most popular cryptocurrency app, serving as both a wallet and a gateway to the Ethereum ecosystem. Think of MetaMask as a "browser for blockchain" that allows users to connect to decentralized applications, manage their cryptocurrency holdings, and interact with smart contracts. MetaMask stores private keys locally on the user's device, providing security while maintaining accessibility.

1. **Edge Wallet** is another popular option for privacy-minded folks, particularly for mobile users. It supports multiple cryptocurrencies and provides features like built-in exchange functionality, allowing users to trade between different cryptocurrencies without leaving the app. Edge Wallet also emphasizes security through features like biometric authentication and encrypted storage.

[!Note] The term "wallet" can be very confusing, vague, and imprecise. Sometimes it refers to the App, sometimes the currency-speicifc container inside an App, and sometimes the address to that currency-speicifc container. 

[TODO: Insert some screenshots of wallets and apps, with different wallets, and addresses.]

Other notable apps include:
- **Trust Wallet**: Mobile-first wallet with support for thousands of cryptocurrencies
- **Exodus**: Desktop wallet with built-in exchange and portfolio tracking
- **Atomic Wallet**: Multi-currency wallet with staking capabilities
- **Phantom**: Solana-focused wallet with DeFi integration

Each app has different security features, and different supported cryptocurrencies. 

### Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets are digital tools that store private keys and allow users to send, receive, and manage their cryptocurrency holdings. Unlike traditional wallets that hold physical money, cryptocurrency wallets don't actually store cryptocurrency. Instead, they store the private keys that provide access to cryptocurrency on the blockchain.

**Digital Wallets (Hot Wallets)** are software-based wallets that are connected to the internet (ex. Edge Wallet). They offer convenience and accessibility but come with increased security risks.

**Advantages of Digital Wallets:**
- Easy to use and set up
- Quick access to funds for trading
- Integration with DeFi protocols and dApps
- Real-time balance updates
- Backup and recovery options

**Disadvantages of Digital Wallets:**
- Vulnerable to hacking and malware
- Dependent on device security
- Risk of losing funds if device is compromised
- Limited protection against user error

**Hardware Wallets (Cold Wallets)** are physical devices that store private keys offline, providing the highest level of security for cryptocurrency storage.

**Advantages of Hardware Wallets:**
- Maximum security through offline storage
- Protection against malware and hacking
- Physical confirmation required for transactions
- Long-term storage solution
- Backup and recovery capabilities

**Disadvantages of Hardware Wallets:**
- Higher cost (typically $50-200)
- Less convenient for frequent trading
- Risk of physical damage or loss
- Learning curve for setup and use
- Limited integration with DeFi protocols

**Popular Hardware Wallets:**
- **Ledger Nano S/X**: Industry standard with support for thousands of cryptocurrencies
- **Trezor Model T**: User-friendly interface with advanced security features
- **SafePal**: Affordable option with mobile app integration
- **BitBox02**: Open-source design with strong security focus

The choice between digital and hardware wallets often depends on use case. Digital wallets are suitable for active traders and DeFi users who need frequent access to their funds. Hardware wallets are better for long-term investors and those holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency.

### Addresses

**Cryptocurrency addresses** are alphanumeric strings that serve as destinations for cryptocurrency transactions. Think of them as email addresses for cryptocurrency. They're public information that others can use to send you cryptocurrency, but they don't reveal your identity or give access to your funds.

**Key Characteristics of Addresses:**
1. **Public Information**: Addresses are meant to be shared publicly
2. **Cryptographically Generated**: Created from private keys using mathematical functions
3. **Unique**: Each address is mathematically unique
4. **Reusable**: Can receive multiple transactions
5. **Pseudonymous**: Don't directly reveal user identity

**Security Considerations:**
- **Address verification**: Always double-check addresses before sending
- **QR codes**: Many wallets use QR codes to prevent typing errors
- **Address book**: Save frequently used addresses to avoid mistakes
- **Test transactions**: Send small amounts first when using new addresses

[!Note] Like having a burner phone for a single use with call forwarding, some wallets allow you to create new addresses for single-use transactions that link back to a consolidated wallet. 

The relationship between apps, wallets, and addresses creates the user experience that makes blockchain technology accessible. **Apps provide the interface, wallets manage the keys, and addresses enable the transactions.** Together they form the foundation of practical cryptocurrency usage. 

## Keys
Since we mention that wallets manage keys, lets talk about them. 

Cryptographic keys are the foundation of blockchain security and cryptocurrency ownership. Understanding how keys work is essential for anyone using blockchain technology, as they represent the only way to access and control cryptocurrency holdings.

### Private Keys vs Public Keys

**Private keys** are the most critical component of cryptocurrency security. Think of a private key as the master password to your cryptocurrency holdings. It's a long string of random numbers and letters that proves ownership of cryptocurrency on the blockchain. Whoever controls the private key controls the cryptocurrency.

[!Note] You may notice apps like Venmo and CashApp have "crypto" components, but...if you don't own the keys, you don't own the money. 

**Public keys** are derived from private keys using mathematical functions. They serve as the "address" where others can send you cryptocurrency. While public keys can be shared freely, private keys must be kept secret at all times.

The relationship between private and public keys is one-way: you can generate a public key from a private key, but you cannot reverse the process to find the private key from the public key. This mathematical relationship is what makes blockchain security possible.

### Recovery Passphrases (Seed Phrases)

**Recovery passphrases** (also called seed phrases, mnemonic phrases, or backup phrases) are human-readable versions of private keys. Instead of a long string of random characters, they consist of 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 common words in a specific order.

**Example of a 12-word recovery passphrase:**
```
abandon conserve finance chair above boat deflect abstract calibrate waterway access maple
```

### Recovery Passphrase Storage Recommendations

Physical Storage (Recommended for long-term holdings):
- **Fireproof safe**: Store in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box
- **Multiple locations**: Keep copies in different secure locations
- **Metal backup**: Consider metal backup plates that survive fire/water damage
- **Off-site storage**: Keep one copy in a different building or city

Digital Storage (Use with extreme caution):
- **Encrypted files**: Store in encrypted files with strong passwords
- **Password managers**: Use reputable password managers with 2FA (like Bitwarden or 1Pass)
- **Never plain text**: Never store passphrases in unencrypted text files
- **Air-gapped devices**: Consider dedicated devices not connected to the internet

What NOT to do:
- ❌ Store on cloud services (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)
- ❌ Send via email or messaging apps
- ❌ Store on shared computers
- ❌ Take photos with smartphones
- ❌ Share with family members "just in case"
- ❌ Store in password managers without 2FA

### Recovery Process

When setting up a new wallet:
1. Write down the recovery passphrase immediately
1. Verify each word is spelled correctly
1. Test the recovery process before storing any cryptocurrency
1. Store the passphrase securely before adding funds

If you lose access to your wallet:
1. Use the recovery passphrase to restore access
1. Transfer funds to a new wallet with a new passphrase
1. Never reuse compromised passphrases

### Security Considerations

Physical security is often more important than digital security for recovery passphrases. Consider:
- Fire damage to paper backups
- Water damage in floods
- Theft from homes or offices
- Natural disasters

Social engineering attacks target recovery passphrases through:
- Phishing emails claiming to be from wallet providers
- Fake customer support calls
- Malicious software that scans for passphrases
- Shoulder surfing when entering passphrases

Remember: Your private keys and recovery passphrases are the only things standing between your cryptocurrency and potential loss. Treat them with the same care you would treat physical gold or cash. The convenience of digital currency comes with the responsibility of proper key management. 

## Exchanges and Uses

Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies. They serve as the primary on-ramps and off-ramps between traditional financial systems and blockchain networks.

### Fiat-to-Crypto

Fiat-to-crypto exchanges allow users to purchase cryptocurrency using traditional currencies like USD, EUR, or GBP. These are typically the first point of contact for newcomers to cryptocurrency. This is the "on-ramp" from traditional banking systems to cryptocurrencies.
