# Risk Management Frameworks: Cryptocurrency Investment Strategies

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive risk management frameworks for cryptocurrency investments, designed to help financial professionals identify, measure, monitor, and mitigate the unique risks associated with digital assets. Cryptocurrency investments present distinct risk characteristics that require specialized risk management approaches beyond traditional investment risk frameworks.

Effective cryptocurrency risk management requires understanding both traditional financial risks and cryptocurrency-specific risks, including technological, regulatory, and operational risks. These frameworks provide structured approaches for managing these risks while maintaining investment objectives and client expectations.
