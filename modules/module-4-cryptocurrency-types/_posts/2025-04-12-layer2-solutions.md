# Layer 2 Solutions for Scaling

The Lightning Network is a Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that enables instant, low-cost transactions by creating payment channels between users. Instead of broadcasting every transaction to the Bitcoin network, users can make multiple transactions through a payment channel, with only the opening and closing transactions recorded on the main blockchain.

These Layer 2 solutions are crucial for the long-term viability of cryptocurrency networks, as they enable the networks to handle the transaction volume needed for widespread adoption.  Networks with effective scaling solutions may be more likely to achieve widespread adoption and maintain their value over time. However, they also add complexity to the ecosystem and may introduce new security considerations.
