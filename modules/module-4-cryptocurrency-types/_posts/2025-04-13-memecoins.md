# Memecoins

Memecoins represent one of the most unique and controversial categories in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These are cryptocurrencies that are created primarily for entertainment, community building, or as internet culture phenomena, often with little to no underlying utility or technological innovation.

Memecoins are cryptocurrencies that derive their value primarily from social media hype, community engagement, and viral marketing rather than technological innovation or real-world utility. They often feature catchy names, internet memes, or pop culture references that resonate with online communities.

Notable examples of memecoins:
- **Dogecoin (DOGE)**: Originally created as a joke based on the "Doge" meme, it became one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies
- **Shiba Inu (SHIB)**: Inspired by Dogecoin, created as a "Dogecoin killer" with a large token supply
- **Pepe (PEPE)**: Based on the popular "Pepe the Frog" meme, gained significant attention in 2023
- **Floki Inu (FLOKI)**: Named after Elon Musk's dog, capitalizing on the Dogecoin phenomenon

Memecoins can experience massive price increases in short periods, but they can also lose value just as quickly. Many memecoins have limited liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell large amounts without significantly affecting the price. Traditional investment analysis methods are often irrelevant for memecoins, as their value is driven by sentiment rather than fundamentals. Success in memecoin investing often depends on entering and exiting at the right time, which is extremely difficult to predict.

> **Coins vs Tokens** But if they are called meme-coins, they have a native blockchain? Yes and no. Some meme-coins should in fact be called meme-tokens, for example PEPE is built on ETH as it's Layer 1. But DOGE is a native coin on it's own blockchain.
