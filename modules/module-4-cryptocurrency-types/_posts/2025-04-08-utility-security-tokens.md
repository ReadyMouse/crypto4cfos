# Utility Tokens vs Security Tokens

Understanding the distinction between utility tokens and security tokens is crucial for financial professionals, as it has significant implications for regulation, taxation, and investment analysis.

Utility tokens are cryptocurrencies that provide access to a specific product or service within a blockchain ecosystem. They're not designed as investments but rather as a means of accessing functionality. For example, Filecoin tokens are used to pay for decentralized storage services, while Basic Attention Token (BAT) is used within the Brave browser ecosystem to reward content creators and advertisers.

Security tokens, on the other hand, represent ownership of an underlying asset, such as equity in a company, real estate, or other traditional securities. These tokens are subject to securities regulations and must comply with the same rules as traditional securities.

The distinction between utility tokens and security tokens is not always clear, and regulatory guidance has evolved over time. The Howey Test, developed by the US Supreme Court, is often used to determine whether a token qualifies as a security. If a token involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profit from the efforts of others, it may be classified as a security.

For financial professionals, this distinction is important for several reasons. Security tokens are subject to strict regulatory requirements, including registration with regulatory authorities and compliance with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations. Utility tokens may have fewer regulatory requirements but may also offer less investor protection.

The regulatory landscape for tokens is still evolving, and financial professionals need to stay current with developments in this area. The classification of a token can have significant implications for how it can be traded, who can invest in it, and what disclosures are required.
