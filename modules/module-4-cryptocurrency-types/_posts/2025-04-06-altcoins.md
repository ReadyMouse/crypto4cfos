# Altcoins: The Alternative Cryptocurrencies

> The term "altcoin" refers to any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. 

Since Bitcoin's creation, thousands of altcoins have been developed, each with its own unique characteristics and use cases.

**Ethereum** is perhaps the most significant altcoin, often referred to as the "world computer." Unlike Bitcoin, which was designed primarily as a payment system, Ethereum was created to be a platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This makes Ethereum more than just a cryptocurrency, it's a complete ecosystem for building decentralized applications.

Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), serves multiple purposes. It's used to pay for transaction fees on the network, it's required to participate in the network's consensus mechanism, and it's used as collateral in various DeFi applications. This multi-faceted utility makes Ethereum's value proposition more complex than Bitcoin's.

Other major altcoins include: 
* **Binance Coin (BNB)**, which powers the Binance exchange ecosystem, and 
* **Cardano (ADA)**, which aims to provide a more sustainable and scalable alternative to Ethereum.

Unlike Bitcoin, which has a relatively simple value proposition, altcoins often derive their value from complex ecosystems and use cases.
