# Landscape Overview: CEX, DEXs, and Marketplaces

Cryptocurrency exchanges are platforms that facilitate the buying, selling, and trading of cryptocurrencies. They serve as the primary on-ramps and off-ramps between traditional financial systems and blockchain networks. Kraken was just one explain, here we will continue the discussion.

> The cryptocurrency exchange landscape splits into two fundamental approaches: centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). 

Centralized exchanges operate much like traditional stock brokerages - they're companies with customer service, regulated operations, and they hold your funds in their custody. Think of them as the "banks" of crypto, offering convenience, user-friendly interfaces, and regulatory compliance, but requiring trust in a central authority. Decentralized exchanges operate entirely on blockchain smart contracts without any central authority. They're more like automated trading posts where you retain full control of your funds, but they require more technical knowledge and offer less hand-holding. CEXs are perfect for beginners and fiat on-ramping, while DEXs shine for experienced users who prioritize self-custody and access to newer, experimental tokens.

## Fiat-to-Crypto aka On-Ramping

Fiat-to-crypto exchanges allow users to purchase cryptocurrency using traditional currencies like USD, EUR, or GBP. These are typically the first point of contact for newcomers to cryptocurrency. This is the "on-ramp" from traditional banking systems to cryptocurrencies.

Fiat-to-Crypto:
**Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):**
- **[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)**: One of the largest US-based exchanges, publicly traded
- **[Binance](https://binance.us)**: Global exchange with extensive trading pairs and services
- **[Kraken](https://kraken.com)**: Established exchange known for security and compliance
- **[Gemini](https://gemini.com)**: Founded by the Winklevoss twins, focused on institutional clients
- FTX.US: (Note: FTX collapsed in 2022, highlighting exchange risk)

**Other On-Ramping Methods**
- **Mining:** In some sense, mining turns cash into electricity into crypto. 
- **ATMs:** Bitcoin ATMS offer cash to crypto services (often more than just Bitcoin)
- **[zkp2p](https://www.zkp2p.xyz/):** Offers peer-to-peer on-ramping
- **Peer-to-peer:** *Back in my day*...crypto traders gathered in bars and backrooms to exchange physical cash for crypto. Ah, the Craigslist days of crypto. 
- **Goods, Services, and Sugar Daddies:** Getting paid in crypto for goods and services is another way to escape traditional finance systems for the brave new world of digital cash. 

Security Considerations:
- **KYC/AML requirements**: Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering requirements: Most exchanges require identity verification
- **Account limits**: Daily/monthly purchase limits based on verification level
- **Geographic restrictions**: Some exchanges don't serve all countries
- **Regulatory compliance**: Varies by jurisdiction

Best Practices:
- Start with small amounts to test the process
- Use exchanges with strong security reputations
- Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Consider fees when choosing payment methods
- Transfer cryptocurrency to your own wallet after purchase
