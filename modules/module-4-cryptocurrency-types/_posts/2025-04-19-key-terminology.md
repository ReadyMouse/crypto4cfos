# Review of Key Terminology

- **Altcoin**: Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin (alternative coin).

- **Blockchain Trilemma**: The challenge of achieving decentralization, security, and scalability simultaneously in blockchain networks.

- **CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency)**: Digital form of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by the nation's central bank.

- **Coin**: Native cryptocurrency of its own blockchain network (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana).

- **DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)**: Organization governed by smart contracts and token holder voting rather than traditional hierarchy.

- **DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Financial services built on blockchain technology without traditional intermediaries.

- **Fiat-Collateralized Stablecoin**: Stablecoin backed by reserves of traditional currency (Tether, USDC).

- **Governance Token**: Cryptocurrency that gives holders voting rights in protocol decisions and DAO governance.

- **Layer 0 (L0)**: Foundational infrastructure layer providing cross-chain interoperability and shared services (Polkadot, Cosmos).

- **Layer 1 (L1)**: Base blockchain networks that process transactions directly (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana).

- **Lightning Network**: Layer 2 solution for Bitcoin that enables instant, low-cost transactions through payment channels.

- **Layer 2 (L2)**: Protocols built on top of Layer 1 blockchains for improved scalability (Lightning Network, Rollups).

- **Memecoin**: Cryptocurrency deriving value primarily from social media hype and community engagement rather than utility.

- **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)**: Unique digital asset that represents ownership of a specific item, digital or physical, with verifiable authenticity and ownership rights.

- **Opaque Ledger**: Blockchain where transaction details are encrypted and hidden from public view (Zcash, Monero).

- **Open Ledger**: Blockchain where all transactions are publicly visible (Bitcoin, Ethereum).

- **Privacy Coin**: Cryptocurrency designed to provide enhanced anonymity and privacy features (Monero, Zcash).

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: Consensus mechanism where validators stake cryptocurrency as collateral to secure the network.

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve mathematical puzzles to validate transactions.

- **Proof of Authority (PoA)**: Consensus mechanism where trusted entities are given the right to create blocks and validate transactions.

- **Rollup**: Layer 2 scaling solution that bundles multiple transactions and submits them to Layer 1 as a single transaction.

- **Security Token**: Digital asset representing ownership of an underlying asset, subject to securities regulations.

- **Smart Contract**: Self-executing computer programs that automatically execute when certain conditions are met.

- **Stablecoin**: Cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, typically fiat currency.

- **Token**: Digital asset built on top of existing blockchain networks using smart contracts (ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum).

- **Tokenomics**: Economic model of a cryptocurrency including supply, distribution, and incentive mechanisms.

- **Utility Token**: Cryptocurrency that provides access to specific products or services within a blockchain ecosystem.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Cryptographic methods that allow verification of information without revealing the underlying data, used in privacy coins like Zcash.
