# Essential Crypto Vocabulary

Understanding crypto culture requires learning its language. Here are the essential terms that will help you navigate conversations and understand what people are actually talking about:

**HODL**
This started as a misspelling of "hold" in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post by a drunk user explaining why he wouldn't sell during a price crash. It's now an acronym for "Hold On for Dear Life" and represents the strategy of buying cryptocurrency and holding it long-term, regardless of price volatility. When someone says they're "HODLing," they're declaring their intention to weather any storm.

**gm (good morning)**
This simple greeting became a cultural phenomenon in crypto. People say "gm" regardless of time zone or actual time of day. It's a way of signaling membership in the crypto community and maintaining the positive, community-driven vibe that many spaces try to cultivate. Responding to someone's "gm" with "gm" back is considered good etiquette.

Also see "get money".

**BUIDL**
Another intentional misspelling, this time of "build." It represents the philosophy of focusing on building useful technology and applications rather than just speculating on prices. When someone says they're "BUIDLing," they're emphasizing the constructive, long-term approach to cryptocurrency development.

**Diamond Hands**
This refers to someone who holds onto their investments through extreme volatility without selling. It's considered a virtue in crypto culture, representing strength, conviction, and long-term thinking. The opposite is "paper hands," which describes someone who sells at the first sign of trouble.

**WAGMI / NGMI**
"We're All Gonna Make It" and "Not Gonna Make It." WAGMI represents community solidarity and shared optimism. NGMI is used (sometimes harshly) to describe someone making poor decisions or displaying behavior that suggests they won't succeed in crypto.

**Ape In**
To invest in something quickly and with little research, usually driven by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Comes from the idea of acting like an ape, impulsively and without much thought. Surprisingly, this isn't always considered a bad thing in certain contexts.

**Rekt**
Short for "wrecked," meaning to lose a significant amount of money on an investment. It's become a way to commiserate with others who have experienced losses and acknowledge the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investing.

**Degen**
Short for "degenerate gambler." In crypto, it's often used as a term of endearment for someone who takes high risks in pursuit of high rewards. Being called a "degen" isn't necessarily an insult, it's recognition of someone's willingness to take calculated (or not so calculated) risks.
