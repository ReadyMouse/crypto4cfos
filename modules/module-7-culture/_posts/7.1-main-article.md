## Introduction

Welcome to the most entertaining module of this course. If cryptocurrency is the technology, then crypto culture is the social fabric that surrounds it. Think of this as your anthropological guide to a digital frontier that operates by its own rules, speaks its own language, and has tribal dynamics that would make a high school guidance counselor nostalgic (or gag).

For financial professionals, understanding crypto culture isn't just academic curiosity. Your clients are increasingly part of these communities, and their investment decisions are often influenced by social dynamics as much as financial analysis. A tweet from the right influencer can move markets more than a quarterly earnings report. A meme can launch a billion-dollar token. Welcome to the wild west of digital finance, where culture and capital collide.

This module will decode the language, explain the gathering places, and help you understand the tribal dynamics that drive much of cryptocurrency behavior. By the end, you'll understand why someone might say "gm" at 3 PM, why "diamond hands" is considered a virtue, and why certain conferences feel more like rock concerts than financial events.

## The High School Cafeteria Analogy

Imagine walking into a massive high school cafeteria, but instead of teenagers, it's populated by adults with smartphones, strong opinions about monetary policy, and enough disposable income to make questionable investment decisions.

> An OG Bitcoin miner admitted to me that they spent +$100k to become a supporting memeber of the International Cryptozoology Museum, gaing free admission (the museum costs $10 per ticket). We love, what we love.

Nevertheless, the dynamics are surprisingly similar to what you remember from your own school days.

**The Bitcoin Bros (The Jocks)**
These are the popular kids of crypto. They arrived early, they're loud, they're confident, and they dominate the conversation. Bitcoin maximalists (aka maxis) believe their coin is the only "real" cryptocurrency, and they'll tell you so repeatedly. They wear their Bitcoin holdings like varsity jackets and have an almost religious devotion to their digital gold.

You'll recognize them by their laser eyes profile pictures on Twitter (a sign of commitment to Bitcoin reaching $100,000), their tendency to measure everything in "sats" (the smallest unit of Bitcoin), and their firm belief that everything else is just a distraction from the one true cryptocurrency. They throw around terms like "toxic Bitcoin Twitter" as a badge of honor and genuinely believe they're saving the world from fiat currency debasement. 

Given their blind devotion, they often doesn't fully understand the technology and make false claims about it's security and privacy. 

**The Ethereum Enthusiasts (The Student Council)**
These are the achievers who believe in building better systems. They're excited about smart contracts, decentralized applications, and "changing the world through code." They tend to be more inclusive than the Bitcoin maximalists and genuinely believe they're building the future of finance and the internet.

They gather around discussions of gas fees, Layer 2 solutions, and the next upgrade to the Ethereum network. They use terms like "DeFi summer" and "NFT utility" with the same enthusiasm your kid might discuss their college applications.

**The DeFi Degens (The Risk-Takers)**
These are the kids who would skateboard down the school stairs just to see if they could. "Degen" is short for "degenerate gambler," and it's a term they've embraced with pride. They're constantly hunting for the next 100x return, jumping between protocols, and treating their cryptocurrency portfolio like a high-stakes video game.

They speak in APYs (Annual Percentage Yields), discuss "aping into" new projects, and somehow always know about the latest farming opportunity that promises impossible returns. They're the ones who turn a $1,000 investment into $50,000, then lose it all the next week trying to recreate the magic.

**The Zcashers (The Honor Students in the Corner)**
These are the privacy advocates, the cryptography enthusiasts, and the people who actually read Satoshi's whitepaper for fun. They believe strongly in financial privacy and tend to be more technically sophisticated than most other groups. They quietly build amazing technology while the rest of the cafeteria argues about price predictions.

You'll find them discussing zero-knowledge proofs, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and the philosophical implications of financial surveillance. They're often underappreciated by the broader crypto community, much like the honor students who everyone copies homework from but rarely invites to parties.

**The Altcoin Army (The Various Clubs)**
These are the enthusiasts for specific cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Each coin has its own passionate community. There are the Cardano scholars who believe in peer-reviewed research, the Solana speed demons who prioritize transaction throughput, and dozens of other tribes, each convinced their chosen technology will eventually rule the world.

**The Skeptics and Regulators (The Faculty)**
These are the adults in the room, trying to bring order to the chaos. They include traditional finance professionals, regulators, and anyone who asks uncomfortable questions like "But what's the real use case?" They're often dismissed by the true believers but serve an important function in keeping the ecosystem grounded in reality.

## Essential Crypto Vocabulary

Understanding crypto culture requires learning its language. Here are the essential terms that will help you navigate conversations and understand what people are actually talking about:

**HODL**
This started as a misspelling of "hold" in a 2013 Bitcoin forum post by a drunk user explaining why he wouldn't sell during a price crash. It's now an acronym for "Hold On for Dear Life" and represents the strategy of buying cryptocurrency and holding it long-term, regardless of price volatility. When someone says they're "HODLing," they're declaring their intention to weather any storm.

**gm (good morning)**
This simple greeting became a cultural phenomenon in crypto. People say "gm" regardless of time zone or actual time of day. It's a way of signaling membership in the crypto community and maintaining the positive, community-driven vibe that many spaces try to cultivate. Responding to someone's "gm" with "gm" back is considered good etiquette.

Also see "get money".

**BUIDL**
Another intentional misspelling, this time of "build." It represents the philosophy of focusing on building useful technology and applications rather than just speculating on prices. When someone says they're "BUIDLing," they're emphasizing the constructive, long-term approach to cryptocurrency development.

**Diamond Hands**
This refers to someone who holds onto their investments through extreme volatility without selling. It's considered a virtue in crypto culture, representing strength, conviction, and long-term thinking. The opposite is "paper hands," which describes someone who sells at the first sign of trouble.

**WAGMI / NGMI**
"We're All Gonna Make It" and "Not Gonna Make It." WAGMI represents community solidarity and shared optimism. NGMI is used (sometimes harshly) to describe someone making poor decisions or displaying behavior that suggests they won't succeed in crypto.

**Ape In**
To invest in something quickly and with little research, usually driven by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). Comes from the idea of acting like an ape, impulsively and without much thought. Surprisingly, this isn't always considered a bad thing in certain contexts.

**Rekt**
Short for "wrecked," meaning to lose a significant amount of money on an investment. It's become a way to commiserate with others who have experienced losses and acknowledge the high-risk nature of cryptocurrency investing.

**Degen**
Short for "degenerate gambler." In crypto, it's often used as a term of endearment for someone who takes high risks in pursuit of high rewards. Being called a "degen" isn't necessarily an insult, it's recognition of someone's willingness to take calculated (or not so calculated) risks.

## The Digital Gathering Places

It's not surprising that most crypto communities congregate in digital spaces, ditching tradtional office buildings. 

**Twitter (Now X)**
Twitter is the town square of crypto. This is where news breaks, where influencers share their thoughts, and where much of the real-time conversation happens. Crypto Twitter (often abbreviated as "CT") is a subculture within Twitter that includes everyone from teenage DeFi farmers to institutional investors.

Key characteristics of Crypto Twitter:
- Fast-moving conversations that can influence market prices
- Heavy use of emojis, especially laser eyes, diamonds, and rockets
- Threads (long-form posts split into multiple tweets) explaining complex topics
- Quote tweets that often contain more insight than the original posts
- Just like the high school cafeteria, it is full of trolls and bullies

**Discord**
Discord servers are where the real community building happens. These are organized, persistent chat rooms where specific cryptocurrency projects maintain their communities. Unlike Twitter's public chaos, Discord allows for more organized, topic-specific conversations.

Most cryptocurrency projects have official Discord servers where:
- Developers share updates and technical information
- Community members ask questions and get support
- Announcements about new features or partnerships are made
- More casual conversation happens in general channels

Since Discord isn't parseable by Google and other search engines, finding information can be difficult. While these discussions used to happen on Stack Overflow, this is a big Red Flag for future developers, who google their blockchain problems, and get no response, because every discussion is hidden behind Discord's servers.

**Telegram**
Telegram is popular for more immediate, informal communication. Many cryptocurrency projects use Telegram channels for announcements and Telegram groups for community discussion. It's particularly popular in international crypto communities and for projects that value privacy.

> **Warning** Telegram is completely un-encrypted! It is a postcard through the mail; sender, receiver, message all in the open. 

Telegram has less protections than simple SMS, and none of the protections of Signal Private Messanger.  

Case Study: Jose and Caroline are discussing purchasing some new gadget over the weekend via Telegram. Since Caroline is a high profile person in the cryptoworld, her telegram handle is widely known and all her communications are being watched. When Caroline sends a BTC address to Jose, there is a third party interceptor that pluck's Caroline's postcard out of the digital mail. 

The third party changes the BTC address to their own, re-signs the post card, and sends it on to Jose. Jose, knowing nothing is amiss, transfers the money directly into the third party account. Caroline gets pissed she doesn't receive the money, a voice calls ensues, addresses compared, and the scam is revealed. 

Due to the irreversibility of blockchain, the money is gone forever. This is not a hypotetical case, this is a real scam. This is a real capibility of Telegram. That being said, the blockchina community does seem to favor it.

> Use Signal Private Messager for all communications. It's simply the best.

**Reddit**
Various cryptocurrency subreddits serve as long-form discussion forums. r/Bitcoin, r/Ethereum, r/CryptoCurrency, and hundreds of project-specific subreddits host detailed discussions, technical analysis, and community governance discussions. Reddit tends to favor longer-form content and more thoughtful discussion than Twitter.

## Major Conferences and Events

Crypto conferences are where the digital tribes gather in person, and each has its own distinct personality and vibe. Some digital nomads are "on the circuit," meaning they travel from conference to networking event to impromptu developer cities without having a dedicated home base. Since conferences and events are where these developers, traders, and crypto enthusiasts see their colleagues, it becomes a traveling office spanning the globe. For many in the crypto world, this nomadic lifestyle represents the ultimate freedom that decentralized technology promises. 

**[Bitcoin Conferences](https://b.tc/conference)**
This is the largest Bitcoin-only conference, and it feels like a combination of a tech conference and a religious revival. Attendees are true believers, the speakers include politicians and celebrities, and the energy is intense. Imagine a stadium full of people who genuinely believe they're part of a monetary revolution.

The vibe is optimistic, sometimes bordering on evangelical. You'll hear phrases like "fix the money, fix the world" and see people wearing Bitcoin-themed clothing as proudly as sports fans wear team jerseys. The conference often features political figures speaking about Bitcoin adoption and monetary policy.

**[Consensus](https://consensus.coindesk.com/)**
Hosted by CoinDesk, Consensus is one of the largest multi-cryptocurrency conferences. It's more corporate than the Bitcoin Conference, with a mix of entrepreneurs, investors, and traditional finance professionals. The vibe is professional networking meets tech startup energy.

**[ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/)**
This Ethereum-focused conference has a distinctly different energy. It's more collaborative, more focused on building and creating, and tends to attract developers and entrepreneurs rather than pure investors. The hackathon component means people are actually building new applications during the conference.

> It's a party, it's a festival, it's a conference and you'll likely look out of place in a business suit. 

**[Zcash Foundation Events](https://zfnd.org/zcon/)**
These tend to be smaller, more intimate gatherings focused on privacy technology and cryptography. The vibe is academic and thoughtful, with deep technical discussions and a focus on the philosophical implications of privacy technology. Think academic conference meets advocacy group.

**DeFi and NFT Events**
These conferences tend to be younger, more experimental, and often feel more like art festivals than traditional business conferences. There's often live music, digital art displays, and a general party atmosphere mixed with serious technical discussions.

**Pop-Up Cities and Digital Nomad Hubs**
The crypto community has created a new phenomenon: temporary cities and permanent hubs where digital nomads gather to build, network, and live the crypto lifestyle. These represent a new kind of conference experience that lasts months rather than days.

**Network States and Crypto Cities**
Several ambitious projects aim to create permanent crypto-friendly cities or "network states." These range from practical initiatives like establishing crypto-friendly jurisdictions to more experimental concepts like floating cities or special economic zones designed around cryptocurrency adoption.

**Nomad Hubs with Crypto Communities**
Certain cities have become magnets for crypto digital nomads:

- **Lisbon, Portugal**: Low cost of living, crypto-friendly regulations, and a thriving startup scene
- **Medellín, Colombia**: Perfect timezone for US collaboration, affordable living, growing tech scene
- **Canggu, Bali**: Tropical lifestyle, established nomad infrastructure, active crypto community
- **Buenos Aires, Argentina**: Strong crypto adoption due to currency instability, vibrant tech culture
- **Mexico City**: Cultural richness, reasonable costs, growing fintech and crypto scene
- **Dubai, UAE**: Crypto-friendly government policies, luxury lifestyle, international business hub

These cities host regular crypto meetups, coworking spaces full of blockchain developers, and informal networks that operate like permanent, distributed conferences. For many crypto professionals, these locations offer the perfect blend of lifestyle, community, and business opportunity.

**Local Meetups and Event Discovery**

While major conferences get the headlines, the real community building happens at local meetups. These smaller gatherings are where relationships form, collaborations begin, and knowledge gets shared in intimate settings. For financial professionals trying to understand crypto culture, attending a local meetup is often more educational than any large conference.

- **[Lu.ma](https://luma.com/crypto**: The most popular platform for crypto meetups and events. Lu.ma has become the go-to place for discovering everything from casual drinks to technical workshops in your city.

- **[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/cryptomondaysnyc/)**: Still relevant for crypto groups, especially in smaller cities. Search for "Bitcoin," "Ethereum," "Blockchain," or "Web3" to find local communities.

- **[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/crypto/?q=crypto&mode=search)**: Hosts many crypto events, particularly educational workshops and networking sessions.

- **[Crypto Nomad](https://cryptonomads.org/)**: A community of developers, and travelling crypto adovacates

- **Telegram Groups**: Many cities have Telegram groups dedicated to organizing impromptu meetups and sharing local crypto events.

- **Community Managed Lists**: [Sheeetz.xyz](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xWmIHyEyOmPHfkYuZkucPRlLGWbb9CF6Oqvfl8FUV6k/edit?pli=1&gid=2048840578#gid=2048840578) is an example of the community posting it's own events and conferences

The beauty of local meetups is their accessibility. Unlike expensive conferences, most local crypto events are free or low-cost, making them perfect entry points for anyone trying to understand the community firsthand.

## Memes, Inside Jokes, and Viral Moments

Crypto culture is heavily driven by memes and viral moments that often become part of the permanent cultural lexicon.

**The "This is Fine" Dog**
Borrowed from general internet culture, this meme is frequently used during market crashes when cryptocurrency prices are falling but the community maintains optimism (or gallows humor).

[TODO: Add the meme]

**"Number Go Up" Technology**
A slightly sarcastic term for the tendency of some cryptocurrency projects to focus more on price appreciation than actual utility or technology development.

**"Few Understand"**
Often used ironically when someone shares what they believe is profound insight about cryptocurrency that others don't appreciate. It's become a way to gently mock the tendency toward crypto elitism.

**Pizza Day**
May 22nd is celebrated as Bitcoin Pizza Day, commemorating the first real-world Bitcoin transaction when someone paid 10,000 Bitcoin for two pizzas. It's become an annual reminder of Bitcoin's early days and its price appreciation.

**"Laser Eyes Until 100K"**
A movement where Bitcoin supporters changed their profile pictures to have laser eyes, pledging to keep them until Bitcoin reached $100,000. It demonstrated community coordination and shared goals.

[TODO: Add the meme]

**Dogecoin and Elon Musk**
The relationship between Elon Musk's tweets and Dogecoin's price movements became a cultural phenomenon, demonstrating the power of social media influence in cryptocurrency markets.

## Conclusion

Crypto culture might seem strange to traditional financial professionals, but it's a genuine social phenomenon that significantly influences market behavior and investment decisions. Understanding this culture isn't just about staying current with trends, it's about understanding a new form of community organization that combines technology, finance, and social identity.

The tribal dynamics, specialized vocabulary, and digital gathering places create strong communities that influence everything from individual investment decisions to market-wide movements. For financial professionals, this culture represents both an opportunity to better serve clients and a challenge to traditional ways of thinking about financial advice and market analysis.

The key insight is that cryptocurrency isn't just a financial technology, it's a social movement with its own values, language, and ways of organizing. The most successful financial professionals will be those who can bridge the gap between traditional finance and crypto culture, speaking both languages and understanding both sets of values.

As we conclude this exploration of crypto culture, remember that like any social phenomenon, it will continue to evolve. New memes will emerge, new gathering places will develop, and new tribes will form around new technologies. The specific details will change, but the fundamental insight remains: cryptocurrency operates at the intersection of technology, finance, and human psychology.

For financial professionals, understanding crypto culture provides crucial context for client conversations, market analysis, and professional development. Whether you're advising a client who wants to "ape into" the latest DeFi protocol or trying to understand why a particular cryptocurrency's price moved after a celebrity tweet, cultural literacy is becoming as important as financial analysis.

The high school cafeteria never really ended, it just moved online and started trading digital assets. Understanding the social dynamics of this new environment isn't just professionally useful, it's essential for anyone trying to navigate the future of finance.

> Remember: In crypto, culture isn't separate from the technology or the economics, it's an integral part of how everything works. The communities, the language, and the social dynamics are features, not bugs, of how this new financial system operates.
