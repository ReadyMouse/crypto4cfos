# Introduction

Now that we understand the different types of cryptocurrencies and their characteristics, it's time to explore how these digital assets are traded and exchanged. Cryptocurrency trading has evolved from a niche activity to a multi-trillion-dollar market that operates 24/7, presenting both opportunities and challenges for financial professionals and their clients.

Understanding cryptocurrency trading and exchanges is crucial for several reasons. First, it enables you to provide informed advice to clients who want to invest in or trade cryptocurrencies. Second, it helps you understand the market dynamics that influence cryptocurrency prices and volatility. Finally, it positions you to help clients navigate the complex regulatory and tax implications of cryptocurrency trading.

Recall from [Module 4:Fiatto-Crypto On-Ramping](../module-4-cryptocurrency-types/4.1-main-article.md#fiat-to-crypto-aka-on-ramping) we listed out some example CEXs and DEXs: 
**Centralized Exchanges (CEXs):**
- **[Coinbase](https://coinbase.com)**: One of the largest US-based exchanges, publicly traded
- **[Binance](https://binance.us)**: Global exchange with extensive trading pairs and services
- **[Kraken](https://kraken.com)**: Established exchange known for security and compliance
- **[Gemini](https://gemini.com)**: Founded by the Winklevoss twins, focused on institutional clients

**Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs):**
- **[Uniswap](https://uniswap.org)**: Leading DEX on Ethereum with automated market making
- **[SushiSwap](https://sushi.com)**: Fork of Uniswap with additional features
- **[PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance)**: Popular DEX on Binance Smart Chain
- **[dYdX](https://dydx.exchange)**: Decentralized derivatives exchange
- **[NEAR Intents](https://near-intents.org/)**: "The People's Exchange," many smaller cryptocurrencies

The role of cryptocurrency exchanges extends beyond simple trading. They provide essential services such as price discovery, liquidity provision, and market making. They also serve as custodians for users' digital assets, much like traditional banks do today. However, cryptocurrency trading also has unique characteristics. The market operates 24/7, unlike traditional markets that have specific trading hours.

Exchanges also play a critical role in price formation and market efficiency. The prices displayed on major exchanges often serve as benchmarks for the broader cryptocurrency market, influencing everything from investment decisions to regulatory assessments. 

In the last module we took a user's apporach to dicussing centralized and dencentralized exchanges. This module will provide a comprehensive overview of cryptocurrency exchanges from the invester side, plus trading mechanics, risk management strategies, and the regulatory landscape.
