## Case Study: Roman Storm + Tornado Cash

The case of Roman Storm, co-founder of Tornado Cash, represents a significant regulatory flashpoint that highlights the tensions between privacy technology and anti-money laundering enforcement. In August 2023, Storm was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and sanctions violations related to his work on Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency "mixer" that anonymizes transactions.

Tornado Cash operated as a decentralized protocol that allowed users to deposit cryptocurrencies and later withdraw them to different addresses, obscuring the transaction trail. While the technology had legitimate privacy uses, prosecutors alleged that the platform facilitated over $1 billion in money laundering, including funds stolen by North Korean hackers from the Ronin bridge hack ($625 million) and other criminal enterprises.

The case raises fundamental questions about developer liability for decentralized protocols. Storm's defense argues that he merely wrote open-source code and cannot control how others use it, while prosecutors contend that the developers knowingly facilitated illegal activity by failing to implement adequate compliance measures. The outcome could set precedent for how courts treat developers of privacy-focused cryptocurrency tools and whether writing code constitutes criminal activity when that code is later used for illicit purposes.

As of August 2025: Roman's case is still on-going.
