# Centralized Exchanges

Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) operate much like traditional banks and stock exchanges, providing familiar interfaces and services that financial professionals can easily understand. These platforms act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, maintaining order books, facilitating trades, and holding customer funds in custody.

## Similarities to Traditional Banking

**Custodial Services:** Like banks, CEXs hold customer assets in custody. Users deposit their cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies into exchange-controlled wallets, similar to how bank customers deposit money into checking accounts. The exchange manages these funds and executes trades on behalf of users.

**Account Management:** CEXs provide traditional account structures with login credentials, account balances, transaction histories, and customer support - all familiar concepts from traditional banking. Users can view their portfolios, set up recurring purchases, and manage their trading preferences through web and mobile interfaces.

**Regulatory Compliance:** Major CEXs like Coinbase, Kraken, and Gemini operate under (some) regulatory frameworks similar to traditional financial institutions. They implement Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, anti-money laundering (AML) controls, and (may) report to relevant financial authorities.

**Fiat Integration:** CEXs bridge traditional finance and cryptocurrencies by accepting bank transfers, credit cards, and wire transfers. This integration makes them the primary on-ramp for most retail investors entering the cryptocurrency market.

**Professional Trading Tools:** Advanced CEXs offer sophisticated trading platforms with features familiar to institutional traders: margin trading, futures contracts, options, and algorithmic trading capabilities.

## Enhanced Risks Beyond Traditional Finance

Recall from [Module 3:Baby's First On-Ramping](../module-3-practical-usage/3.1-main-article.md#babys-first-on-ramping-buying-btc) we used a CEX (Kraken) to on-ramp fiat into crypto. I will rightly apoligze now, for asking you to put money into such a system without informing you of the potential risks. I shall right that wrong now. 

While CEXs provide familiar interfaces, they introduce risks that don't exist in traditional banking:

**Simple Scam:** For small CEXs operating like an BTC ATM at the local deli, they could just decided to take your cash and not give you BTC as requested. A foreign currency exchange that lies to a dumb tourist about the exchange rate, and pockets the difference. While this wouldn't be good for long term business, and eventually ruin reputation...having a $5-$10 transction go "missing" every now and then, is half-penny scraping to the max.

**Exit Scams and Fraud:** Unlike traditional banks which are heavily regulated and insured, many cryptocurrency exchanges operate with minimal oversight. This has led to numerous high-profile cases where exchanges simply shut down and disappeared with customer funds:

- **QuadrigaCX (2019):** Canada's largest cryptocurrency exchange collapsed after its founder allegedly died with the only access to cold storage wallets containing $190 million in customer funds.
- **FTX (2022):** Once the world's second-largest exchange, FTX filed for bankruptcy amid allegations of misappropriating billions in customer funds for risky trading by affiliated firm Alameda Research.
- **Mt. Gox (2014):** At its peak handling 70% of Bitcoin transactions, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy after revealing that hackers had stolen 850,000 bitcoins over several years.

**Lack of Deposit Insurance:** Traditional bank deposits are typically insured by government agencies (like FDIC in the US), but cryptocurrency exchanges generally offer no such protection. When an exchange fails, customers may lose their entire holdings with little recourse.

> Remember: "Not your keys, not your crypto."

**Regulatory Arbitrage:** Many exchanges operate from jurisdictions with favorable cryptocurrency regulations, but this can leave customers vulnerable if the exchange relocates or if regulations change. Some exchanges have been forced to shut down or restrict services to certain countries with little notice.

**Internal Mismanagement:** Without the strict capital requirements and oversight of traditional banks, cryptocurrency exchanges may engage in risky practices like:
- Using customer funds for proprietary trading
- Inadequate segregation of customer and company assets  
- Poor internal controls and risk management
- Insufficient reserves to meet withdrawal demands

**Technical Vulnerabilities:** Cryptocurrency exchanges are high-value targets for hackers due to the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Unlike traditional banks that can reverse fraudulent transactions, stolen cryptocurrency is typically irrecoverable.

## Risk Mitigation for CEX Users

For financial professionals advising clients on CEX usage:

**Due Diligence:** Research the exchange's regulatory status, insurance coverage, security practices, and financial backing. Prefer exchanges that are publicly traded or subject to regular audits.

**Diversification:** Don't store all cryptocurrency holdings on a single exchange. Use multiple platforms or better yet, move funds into self-custody wallets. 

**Withdrawal Practices:** Regularly withdraw funds to personal wallets rather than storing large amounts on exchanges long-term. 

> Remember: "Not your keys, not your crypto."

**Monitoring:** Stay informed about the exchange's financial health, regulatory status, and any red flags in the cryptocurrency community.

The fundamental principle remains that centralized exchanges, while convenient and familiar, require users to trust a third party with their assets - a trust that has been repeatedly violated in the cryptocurrency space.
