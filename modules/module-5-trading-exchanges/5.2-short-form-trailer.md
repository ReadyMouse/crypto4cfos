# Module 5 Short Form Trailer: Cryptocurrency Trading and Exchanges

## Opening Hook (0:00-0:15)

Think centralized exchanges are just like traditional banks? Think again. The crypto trading landscape spans from custodial CEXs that can disappear with your funds to revolutionary automated market makers that never sleep. As a financial professional, you need to understand these fundamentally different systems to protect your clients.

## The Exchange Reality (0:15-0:45)

Centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken offer familiar interfaces but carry risks traditional banks don't have. No deposit insurance, exit scams like FTX's $8 billion collapse, and the constant threat that "not your keys, not your crypto." Meanwhile, decentralized exchanges use automated market makers and liquidity pools to eliminate counterparty risk while introducing entirely new complexities.

Here's what's crucial: AMMs operate on mathematical formulas, not human market makers. Constant product formulas automatically price trades, but create slippage and impermanent loss. Smart contracts enable 24/7 trading without gatekeepers, but bugs can drain hundreds of millions in minutes.

## Why This Matters for Financial Professionals (0:45-1:30)

Your clients are already trading crypto, whether you know it or not. They need guidance on exchange selection, risk management, and the complex regulatory landscape that varies dramatically by jurisdiction. The Roman Storm case shows how even writing privacy code can lead to criminal charges.

Tax implications are nightmarish. Every crypto trade potentially creates a taxable event. Cost basis tracking across multiple exchanges, DeFi protocols, and wallet addresses requires specialized software and professional guidance. The IRS is actively pursuing unreported crypto income through Operation Hidden Treasure.

Understanding MEV, front-running, and sandwich attacks is essential. On transparent blockchains like Ethereum, sophisticated actors can extract value from your clients' trades unless they use privacy-focused solutions.

## What You'll Master in Module 5 (1:30-2:15)

In this comprehensive module, you'll understand both centralized and decentralized trading systems. From traditional order books to revolutionary automated market makers, you'll grasp how liquidity actually works in crypto markets. You'll explore the risks that don't exist in traditional finance and the innovations that eliminate traditional gatekeepers.

We'll examine real cases like the FTX collapse, QuadrigaCX exit scam, and Wormhole bridge hack. You'll understand why "not your keys, not your crypto" isn't just a slogan but a survival principle. You'll learn about impermanent loss, slippage, and how AMMs create automatic price discovery without human intervention.

Most importantly, you'll gain practical knowledge for advising clients on exchange selection, custody solutions, and tax compliance in this complex regulatory environment.

## The Professional Edge (2:15-2:45)

Financial professionals who understand crypto trading mechanics can provide invaluable guidance on risk management, regulatory compliance, and tax optimization. You'll be able to evaluate exchange security, understand smart contract risks, and help clients navigate the maze of DeFi protocols.

This knowledge positions you to protect clients from common pitfalls while helping them access the benefits of 24/7 global markets, permissionless trading, and innovative financial products that traditional finance can't match.
