# Bitcoin ETFs and Traditional Derivatives

The introduction of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and traditional financial derivatives has created new ways for institutional and retail investors to gain cryptocurrency exposure through familiar investment vehicles and traditional brokerage accounts.

**Bitcoin ETFs** allow investors to gain Bitcoin exposure without directly owning or storing cryptocurrency. Spot Bitcoin ETFs like those from BlackRock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC) hold actual Bitcoin and track its price closely. These instruments offer regulatory oversight, institutional custody, and tax-advantaged account accessibility while charging management fees typically ranging from 0.2% to 0.75% annually.

**Bitcoin Futures ETFs** like ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) provide exposure through Bitcoin futures contracts rather than direct Bitcoin holdings. These may experience tracking errors and contango effects but offer regulated exposure through traditional brokerages. Futures-based ETFs typically have higher expense ratios and may not track Bitcoin prices as closely as spot ETFs.

**Traditional Options and Futures** on Bitcoin ETFs allow sophisticated investors to implement complex strategies like covered calls, protective puts, and collar strategies. These instruments enable hedging, income generation, and leveraged exposure while operating within traditional derivatives frameworks that financial professionals understand.
