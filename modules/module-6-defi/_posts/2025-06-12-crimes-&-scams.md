# Crimes + Scams

No discussion of making money in crypto would be complete without addressing the elephant in the room: the creative and unfortunately lucrative world of cryptocurrency-enabled crimes and scams. While we absolutely do not recommend these approaches, financial professionals must understand these schemes to protect their clients and recognize red flags.

**Classic Ponzi Schemes with Crypto Flavor** promise impossibly high returns through "revolutionary trading algorithms" or "guaranteed arbitrage strategies." Modern versions include yield farming pools that pay early investors with later investors' deposits, and "liquidity mining" programs that collapse when new deposits stop flowing. The key indicator: returns that seem too good to be true consistently delivered regardless of market conditions.
- Technical Skill: Low (mostly marketing and social engineering)
- Financial Skill: Low (understanding basic investment psychology)
- Legal Risk: Extremely High
- Recommended Investment: $0

**NFT Wash Trading and Market Manipulation** involves creating artificial demand by repeatedly buying and selling NFTs between controlled wallets to inflate perceived value before selling to unsuspecting buyers. This practice exploits the transparency of blockchain transactions to create false activity that appears legitimate to casual observers.
- Technical Skill: Intermediate (multiple wallet management)
- Financial Skill: Low to Intermediate
- Legal Risk: High
- Recommended Investment: Your integrity (don't do this)

**Rug Pulls and Exit Scams** represent the crypto equivalent of taking the money and running. Developers create legitimate-looking DeFi protocols, attract substantial liquidity, then drain all funds through backdoors in smart contracts or by removing liquidity pools. Some sophisticated rug pulls operate for months before the inevitable "hack" that coincidentally benefits the developers.
- Technical Skill: High (smart contract development)
- Financial Skill: Intermediate
- Legal Risk: Extremely High
- Recommended Investment: A good lawyer if you're thinking about this

**Money Laundering Through Mixers and Privacy Coins** involves using services like Tornado Cash or privacy-focused cryptocurrencies to obscure transaction origins. While these tools have legitimate privacy uses, they're frequently employed to launder proceeds from ransomware, exchange hacks, and other criminal activities. Recent regulatory crackdowns have made this increasingly risky.
- Technical Skill: Intermediate to High
- Financial Skill: Low
- Legal Risk: Extremely High
- Career Prospects: Limited (federal prison has poor networking opportunities)

**Social Engineering and Romance Scams** exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Scammers build relationships over months, gradually introducing cryptocurrency investment opportunities that victims fund willingly. The "pig butchering" variant involves building trust before directing victims to fake trading platforms that show artificial profits until withdrawal attempts.
- Technical Skill: Low (mostly fake websites)
- Financial Skill: Low
- Psychological Manipulation Skill: Unfortunately High
- Karma: Terrible

Remember: While these schemes may generate short-term profits for perpetrators, they inevitably result in legal consequences, reputational damage, and harm to innocent victims. The crypto space's pseudonymous nature provides less privacy protection than criminals typically assume, with blockchain analysis increasingly sophisticated and law enforcement agencies developing specialized expertise.
