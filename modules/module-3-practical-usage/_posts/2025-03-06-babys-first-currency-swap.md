# Baby's First Currency Swap

But what about privacy? What about other currencies? Just as the US dollar is widely accepted, it's not universally accepted. There are times when we need to change USD for EURO or YEN, in the same vein there are times we want to swap BTC for BTC Lightening or Zcash. For this excerise, we will be swapping BTC for ZEC. Why ZEC? Zcash is a privacy coin, and you'll see what that means in the block explorer. 

> Choose Your Own Adventure: Inter-Wallet or Intra-Wallet

You can perform the currency swap right inside Edge Wallet, this is like using your home back to go from USD to EURO. You can't shop around for the best exchange rates, but it's easy. Or you can swap uses an 3rd party exchange. Let's move $100 BTC to sheiled ZEC.  

Option 1: Inter-Wallet: Edge Wallet

[TODO: Screenshot of the exchange]

Swap out your $100 BTC for sheilded ZEC. Your ZEC address should start with a 'u'. Save the transcation ID, we'll use that in the block explorer. 


Option 2: Intra-Wallet

[TODO: Insert discussion on Trocador or NEAR Intents]

[TODO: Screenshot of the exchange]

Swap out  $100 BTC for sheilded ZEC. Your ZEC address should start with a 'u'. Save the transcation ID, we'll use that in the block explorer. 

[TODO: Insert zcash block explorer and see what you see]

Now's lets go look at what the [Block Explorer](https://blockexplorer.one/)  has to say about the transction. We can see the sender address and amount, but not the receiver address? [TODO: Make this sure is true.]
