# Baby's First Off-ramping

Do you have any BTC left in your stocking? What can you actually DO with bitcoin once you have it? You could save it, invest it, trade it...like a stock. Or you can spend it like cash. For this pratical module, we'll spend it like cash. Introducing....[BitRefill](https://www.bitrefill.com/us/en/). A place that you can buy gift cards with Bitcoin. 

[TODO: Add screenshot bitrefll]

Buy a giftcard with the $50 BTC from your Edge wallet, and now you can spend that gift card on groceries, beer scented soap, or you can use it to tip your favorite sex worker. ;) 

> Grandma and the government isn't watching your Zcash nor your giftcard purchases.

What to do with the remaining ZEC? Save it, swap it, trade it, spend it. No one is watching.
