# Introduction & What is Cryptocurrency?

## Introduction

Cryptocurrency represents one of the most significant financial innovations of the 21st century. For financial professionals — CPAs, CFOs, financial analysts, and advisors — understanding cryptocurrency is no longer optional. Whether you're advising clients on tax implications, evaluating investment opportunities, or ensuring regulatory compliance, cryptocurrency knowledge has become essential to your professional toolkit.

This module provides the foundational understanding you need to navigate the cryptocurrency landscape with confidence and professional competence.

## What is Cryptocurrency?

At its core, cryptocurrency represents a fundamental reimagining of what money can be. It started with the idea of digital cash. "Cash is king." 

Consider that cash has two very nice features: 
1. No Double Spending
1. Peer-to-Peer, Instant, **Anonymous** Transaction

Now in the digital space, cryptocurrency was designed to remove only the in-person aspect of cash. To send money, to anyone, at anytime, regardless of location. While Venmo, Cashapp, etc do this, as well as wire transfers and Zelle, they require a centralized intermediary. It also requires that we trust Venmo not to steal the money, skim half pennies and to actually handle it properly. We also have to trust CashApp not to "mint" fake digital money into an account. 

Enter crypto: The term "cryptocurrency" itself reveals much about its nature. The "crypto" portion refers to cryptography—the mathematical techniques that secure the system and ensure that only the rightful owner can spend their digital assets. It is the mathematical backbone that solves the Double-Spend problem. The "currency" aspect indicates its intended use as a medium of exchange (digital cash). But just as humans have evolved from using salt as a currency to coins and paper money, cryptocurrencies have evolved far beyond simple payment systems.

What makes cryptocurrency revolutionary is its decentralized nature. Traditional financial systems rely on central authorities—banks, governments, payment processors—to validate transactions and maintain trust. Cryptocurrency eliminates these intermediaries by distributing the responsibility across a network of computers, each running the same software and following the same rules. This creates a system where trust is established through mathematics and consensus rather than institutional reputation.

At the core of crypto is the blockchain. Think of the blockchain as a digital ledger, a database, that's maintained by thousands of computers simultaneously, each holding an identical copy. This distributed approach provides some of the security of the system by ensuring that all parties must eventually come to consensus on their view of the data in that database. Another aspect that provides security is the way transaction data is cryptographically signed. Finally, when the network is supported by a bunch of different actors, a single attacker would need to control more than half of the entire network's computers if they wanted to overrule the other participants, a feat that becomes exponentially more difficult as the network grows.

Speaking Publically: When you make a Bitcoin transaction, you're essentially broadcasting a message to a global network of computers. This message contains the details of your transfer: who you're sending money to, how much, and proof that you have the right to spend those funds. The network then works together to verify this transaction using complex mathematical algorithms, ensuring that you can't spend money you don't have and that you can't spend the same money twice. Once verified, your transaction becomes part of a permanent, unchangeable record — **the blockchain**. 

Speaking Privately: When you make a Zcash transaction, you've achieved the digital cash dream. Sender and receiver identity is private, the amount is private, the balance of each account before and after the transaction is private. Using Zero-Knowledge proofs, mathematical guarantees, the network of computers validates the transaction. This is the vision of peer-to-peer, private, digital cash.

From salt and copper coins, we made paper cash, checks, credit cards, stocks, bonds, mortgages, mutual funds, ETFs, sub-prime mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps. Built on gold, humans have created all sorts of assets and derivatives. Crypto is no different.
