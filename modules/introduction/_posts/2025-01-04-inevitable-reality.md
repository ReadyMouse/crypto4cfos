# The Inevitable Reality: Crypto is Here to Stay

> Cryptocurrency is currently at over $2 trillion in market capitalization as of August 2025. 

Major corporations like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have added Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. Traditional financial institutions are offering cryptocurrency custody services. Payment processors like PayPal and Square have integrated crypto payments. Even central banks are developing their own digital currencies. (We'll talk about the pro and cons of this later.)

The VC firm [a16z](https://a16z.com/) alone has over $46 billion in assets under management, with approximately $7.6 billion (about 16.5%) dedicated specifically to crypto and Web3 investments.

This isn't speculative hypeâ€”it's institutional adoption on a massive scale. The question isn't whether cryptocurrency will become mainstream; it's when, and whether you'll be prepared to serve your clients when that happens.

Consider this: Cryptocurrency represents the natural evolution of money, just as we evolved from salt and copper coins to paper money, checks, credit cards, and digital payments. The technology has matured, the regulatory frameworks are developing, and the market infrastructure is in place. The ship has left port, and you need to decide whether you're on board or walking the plank.
