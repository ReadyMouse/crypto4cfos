# Smart Contracts

Now that we have a ledger, with the address to entries, how can we build on it? A smart contract is essentially a computer program that automatically executes actions on the ledger when certain conditions are met. Unlike traditional contracts that rely on legal enforcement, smart contracts are enforced by code. Code that can be audited.

**Use Case:** Imagine a traditional escrow service where a buyer and seller use a third party to hold funds until the transaction is completed. With a smart contract, this entire process can be automated. The buyer sends cryptocurrency to a smart contract address. The seller ships the product. When the buyer confirms receipt, the smart contract automatically releases the funds to the seller. If there's a dispute, the smart contract can hold the funds until the dispute is resolved.

The implications of smart contracts are enormous. They can automate complex financial transactions, reduce the need for intermediaries, and create new types of financial instruments. For example, smart contracts can be used to create automated insurance policies that pay out immediately when certain conditions are met, or to create complex derivative instruments that automatically settle based on market conditions.

However, smart contracts also present new challenges. They're only as good as the code they're written in, and bugs in smart contract code can lead to significant financial losses. 

[TODO: Turn this into a whole case study.]

The infamous [DAO hack in 2016](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/09/coindesk-turns-10-how-the-dao-hack-changed-ethereum-and-crypto), where attackers exploited a bug in a smart contract to steal millions of dollars worth of Ethereum, is a cautionary tale about the importance of proper smart contract development and auditing.
