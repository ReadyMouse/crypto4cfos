# Review of Key Terminology

- **51% Attack**: A theoretical attack where a single entity gains control of more than half of a network's mining power or stake.

- **Aggregator Service**: Platforms that connect multiple exchanges through a single interface to find the best rates and enhance security.

- **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: Regulations designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through financial systems.

- **Consensus Mechanism**: The method by which blockchain networks agree on the validity of transactions and maintain network security.

- **Digital Wallet (Hot Wallet)**: Software-based cryptocurrency storage that is connected to the internet for easy access.

- **Gas Fee**: A transaction fee paid to miners or validators for processing transactions on a blockchain network.

- **Hardware Wallet (Cold Wallet)**: Physical devices that store private keys offline for maximum security.

- **Hash Function**: A mathematical function that converts input data into a fixed-size string of characters, used to link blocks in a blockchain.

- **Immutability**: The characteristic of blockchain data that makes it impossible to alter or delete once recorded.

- **KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Regulatory requirements for financial institutions to verify customer identities.

- **Mining**: The process of validating transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain, typically involving solving complex mathematical puzzles.

- **Open Ledger**: A blockchain where all transactions are publicly visible, like Bitcoin's transparent transaction history.

- **Opaque Ledger**: A blockchain where transaction details are encrypted and hidden from public view, like Zcash's privacy features.

- **Private Key**: A secret cryptographic key that provides access to cryptocurrency holdings and must be kept secure.

- **Proof of Stake (PoS)**: A consensus mechanism where validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they "stake" as collateral.

- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: A consensus mechanism where miners compete to solve mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.
