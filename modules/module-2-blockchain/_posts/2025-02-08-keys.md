# Keys

Since we mention that wallets manage keys, lets talk about them. 

Cryptographic keys are the foundation of blockchain security and cryptocurrency ownership. Understanding how keys work is essential for anyone using blockchain technology, as they represent the only way to access and control cryptocurrency holdings.

## Private Keys vs Public Keys

**Private keys** are the most critical component of cryptocurrency security. Think of a private key as the master password to your cryptocurrency holdings. It's a long string of random numbers and letters that proves ownership of cryptocurrency on the blockchain. Whoever controls the private key controls the cryptocurrency.

> **Warning** You may notice apps like Venmo and CashApp have "crypto" components, but...if you don't own the keys, you don't own the money. 

**Public keys** are derived from private keys using mathematical functions. They serve as the "address" where others can send you cryptocurrency. While public keys can be shared freely, private keys must be kept secret at all times.

The relationship between private and public keys is one-way: you can generate a public key from a private key, but you cannot reverse the process to find the private key from the public key. This mathematical relationship is what makes blockchain security possible.

## Recovery Passphrases (Seed Phrases)

**Recovery passphrases** (also called seed phrases, mnemonic phrases, or backup phrases) are human-readable versions of private keys. Instead of a long string of random characters, they consist of 12, 15, 18, 21, or 24 common words in a specific order.

**Example of a 12-word recovery passphrase:**
```
abandon conserve finance chair above boat deflect abstract calibrate waterway access maple
```

## Recovery Passphrase Storage Recommendations

Physical Storage (Recommended for long-term holdings):
- **Fireproof safe**: Store in a fireproof safe or safety deposit box
- **Multiple locations**: Keep copies in different secure locations
- **Metal backup**: Consider metal backup plates that survive fire/water damage
- **Off-site storage**: Keep one copy in a different building or city

Digital Storage (Use with extreme caution):
- **Encrypted files**: Store in encrypted files with strong passwords
- **Password managers**: Use reputable password managers with 2FA (like Bitwarden or 1Pass)
- **Never plain text**: Never store passphrases in unencrypted text files
- **Air-gapped devices**: Consider dedicated devices not connected to the internet

What NOT to do:
- ❌ Store on cloud services (Google Drive, iCloud, etc.)
- ❌ Send via email or messaging apps
- ❌ Store on shared computers
- ❌ Take photos with smartphones
- ❌ Share with family members "just in case"
- ❌ Store in password managers without 2FA

## Recovery Process

When setting up a new wallet:
1. Write down the recovery passphrase immediately
1. Verify each word is spelled correctly
1. Test the recovery process before storing any cryptocurrency
1. Store the passphrase securely before adding funds

If you lose access to your wallet:
1. Use the recovery passphrase to restore access
1. Transfer funds to a new wallet with a new passphrase
1. Never reuse compromised passphrases

## Security Considerations

Physical security is often more important than digital security for recovery passphrases. Consider:
- Fire damage to paper backups
- Water damage in floods
- Theft from homes or offices
- Natural disasters

Social engineering attacks target recovery passphrases through:
- Phishing emails claiming to be from wallet providers
- Fake customer support calls
- Malicious software that scans for passphrases
- Shoulder surfing when entering passphrases

> Remember: Your private keys and recovery passphrases are the only things standing between your cryptocurrency and potential loss. "Not your keys, not your crypto."

Treat them with the same care you would treat physical gold or cash. The convenience of digital currency comes with the responsibility of proper key management.
