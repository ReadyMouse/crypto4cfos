### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
- WordPress plugins should follow WordPress coding standards and include proper security measures.
- All payment processing must be PCI compliant and follow security best practices.
- The main articles should be mostly discussion-based with a technical but easy to undrestand narrative. It should ressemble a journal or blog post article. It can contain lists were appropiate, like glossary or pro/con comparisons. Main articles should have table of contents at the top.
