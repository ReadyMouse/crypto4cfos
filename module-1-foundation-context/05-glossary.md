# Module 1: Key Terminology Glossary

## Blockchain & Technology Terms

**Blockchain**: A distributed digital ledger that records transactions across a network of computers in a secure, transparent, and immutable manner. Each block contains a list of transactions and is linked to the previous block, creating a chain.

**Cryptography**: The practice of secure communication techniques that allow only the intended recipient to read the information. In cryptocurrency, cryptography ensures that only the rightful owner can spend their digital assets.

**Decentralization**: The distribution of control and decision-making across a network rather than centralizing it in a single authority. This is what makes cryptocurrency fundamentally different from traditional banking.

**Digital Wallet**: Software that stores private keys and allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency. Unlike a physical wallet, it doesn't store cryptocurrencyâ€”it stores the cryptographic keys that prove ownership.

**Mining**: The process of validating transactions and adding them to the blockchain, typically rewarded with cryptocurrency. Miners use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems.

**Node**: A computer that participates in the cryptocurrency network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain and validating transactions.

**Private Key**: A secret number that allows cryptocurrency to be spent and must be kept secure. Think of it as the password to your bank account, but with no way to reset it if lost.

**Public Key**: A cryptographic code that allows users to receive cryptocurrency and can be shared publicly. It's derived from the private key but cannot be used to spend funds.

**Smart Contract**: Self-executing contracts with the terms directly written into code. These programmable agreements can automate complex financial transactions.

**Token**: A digital asset that represents ownership or access rights, often built on existing blockchains. While all cryptocurrencies are tokens, not all tokens are cryptocurrencies.

## Financial & Currency Terms

**Altcoin**: Any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin. Examples include Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple.

**DeFi (Decentralized Finance)**: Financial services built on blockchain technology that operate without traditional intermediaries like banks.

**Fiat Currency**: Government-issued currency that is not backed by a physical commodity (e.g., US Dollar, Euro, Japanese Yen).

**ICO (Initial Coin Offering)**: A fundraising mechanism where companies sell digital tokens to raise capital, similar to an IPO but for cryptocurrency projects.

**Market Capitalization**: The total value of all coins in circulation, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total supply.

**Stablecoin**: A cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US Dollar.

**Volatility**: The degree of variation in cryptocurrency prices over time, typically much higher than traditional assets.

## Regulatory & Compliance Terms

**AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**: Regulations designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing through cryptocurrency transactions.

**KYC (Know Your Customer)**: Requirements for financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers, including cryptocurrency exchanges.

**Regulatory Arbitrage**: The practice of taking advantage of differences in regulations between jurisdictions.

**Securities Law**: Legal framework that may apply to certain cryptocurrency offerings, particularly those that promise returns or represent ownership.

## Professional Practice Terms

**Custody**: The safekeeping of cryptocurrency assets, either by the owner or a third-party service provider.

**Due Diligence**: The investigation and analysis of cryptocurrency investments or services before making decisions.

**Portfolio Allocation**: The distribution of investment capital across different asset classes, including cryptocurrency.

**Risk Management**: Strategies for identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks associated with cryptocurrency investments.

**Tax Basis**: The original cost of an asset for tax purposes, crucial for calculating capital gains and losses on cryptocurrency transactions.

## Additional Terms

**Bear Market**: A market condition characterized by falling prices and pessimism.

**Bull Market**: A market condition characterized by rising prices and optimism.

**FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)**: The anxiety that leads to impulsive investment decisions based on the fear of missing potential gains.

**HODL**: A misspelling of "hold" that became a cryptocurrency meme meaning to hold onto cryptocurrency despite market volatility.

**Whale**: An individual or entity that holds a large amount of cryptocurrency and can significantly influence market prices.
